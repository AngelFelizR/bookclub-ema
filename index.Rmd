## Pace {-}

-  Meet ***every*** week except holidays, etc

-  Meetings = **1 hour.**

-  **Goal:** 1 chapter/week
  -  Ok to split overwhelming chapters
  -  Ok to combine short chapters
  
-  If we need to **slow down** and discuss, **let me know**.
   -  Most likely someone has the same question 
   -  We are all here to learn

## A note {-}
  
-  You are not expected to know everything.
   -  We are all learning.
   -  None of us is as smart as all of us.
   -  It's okay to say "I don't know."
   -  We can stop at anytime to discuss.
